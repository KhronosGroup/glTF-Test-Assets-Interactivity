## Introduction

This Repository contains tests and samples of glTF assets using the KHR_interactivity extension, which allows for the creation of interactive 3D models. KHR_interactivity allows for the creation of interactive elements within 3D scenes, in a graph-based manner.

## Lists

All models are tagged to allow easier access. These lists simplify your access and review of the models. All lists include the model name, screen shot, link to display the model in Sample Viewer, a short description, and the license/credits for the model. The following lists are available

* [Testing](./Models/Models-testing.md) (#testing) for assets that are designed for programmatic or manual testing of KHR_interactivity implementations. These models can either be used to verify the behavior of specific features, or added to test suites to ensure correctness of implementation.
* [Showcase](./Models/Models-showcase.md) (#showcase) for models that demonstrate real-world use cases of glTF Interactivity, ranging from simple to complex.

A summary of the model license is shown in each display, but see the `README.md` in each model's directory for detailed license information.


## Model Contents

Sample glTF 2.0 models are provided in one or more of the following forms of glTF:

* glTF (`.gltf`) with separate resources: `.bin` (geometry, animation, skins) and `.jpg` or `.png` image files.  The supporting files are easily examined when separated like this, but must be kept together with the parent glTF file for the model to work.
* Binary glTF (`.glb`) using the [binary container format](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/2.0/README.md#glb-file-format-specification).  These are easily shared due to the bundling of all the textures and mesh data into a single file.

## Other glTF Models

For additional glTF models, see:

* [Khronos glTF Sample Assets](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets) offers an extensive suite of models demonstrating various glTF features.
